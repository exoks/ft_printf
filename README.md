# ft_printf #
This project is an implementation of ft_printf, a custom printf function in C, developed using my libft library that contains over 40 optimized utility functions.
- It efficiently handles all standard printf flags (-, +, #, 0, ) and conversions (c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, %).
- The project is designed with memory efficiency, and performance in mind.
