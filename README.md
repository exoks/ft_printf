# **ft_printf42** #
This project is an implementation of ft_printf, a custom printf function in C, developed using my libft library that contains over 40 utility functions.
- It handles all standard printf flags **(-, +, #, 0, )**.
- It handles all standard printf conversions **(c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, %)**.
- It includes a **Makefile** that simplifies the process of using the ft_printf function. The Makefile generates a static `libftprintf.a` library.
- It includes **Unit Tests** for each flag and conversion.

### **ft_printf Unit tests** ###
To help 1337 (42 Network) students understand flags and conversions, I have included unit tests for each one. 

**Run the tests**

```bash
make tests
```


**Unit tests Output** :
